# ml-tutorials
Machine learning tutorials: easy-to-follow tutorials, offering a practical approach to understanding the intricacies of various machine learning techniques.

A Jupyter Notebook dedicated to each algorithm, providing concise hands-on code snippets to facilitate hands-on learning.

### data_augmentation.ipynb
There are two general methods for balancing data: majority undersampling, and minority oversampling. This notebook covers random undersampling and oversampling and expands on the latter with SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).
### RL_examples: reinforcement learning

### tf-idf and word2vec comparison

### Simple SVD-based (Singular Value Decomposition) recommender system on a toy dataset
